    "The provided answer lacks detail and specificity, making it difficult to assess the candidate's understanding of designing a scalable data storage solution using Bigtable. It is important for a Software Engineer at Google to demonstrate a solid grasp of the technology being discussed, including its features, best practices, and potential pitfalls. The response could benefit from discussing partitioning strategies, data consistency models, and considerations for high-performance and low-latency access to massive amounts of structured data. It would be helpful if the candidate provided examples or scenarios to illustrate their points.",
    "The answer lacks specificity and does not demonstrate a thorough understanding of the topic. It's essential for a software engineer at Google to have a strong foundation in Bigtable and MapReduce, as they are crucial tools for processing large volumes of data. The response could be improved by providing concrete strategies for optimizing MapReduce jobs, minimizing latency, and handling errors in a distributed environment, backed up with relevant examples or best practices from Google's documentation or real-world projects. Additionally, it's important to showcase an eagerness to learn and adapt to new technologies when needed.",
    "The answer provided lacks detail and fails to meet the expectations set by the question. To provide a comprehensive response, the candidate should have discussed a specific project they worked on, explaining the data processing tasks, any strategies employed for error handling or recovery, and the results achieved in terms of performance improvement. This would demonstrate technical accuracy, communication clarity, and relevance to the role as requested. It's essential to provide a more elaborate answer that showcases the candidate's experience with MapReduce and their ability to tackle large datasets effectively while optimizing resource utilization and reducing latency.",
    "The answer provided does not meet the expectations for a software engineer at Google. The response did not elaborate on how workload balancing was approached in MapReduce jobs or discuss any techniques used to handle errors or failures during task execution. It is crucial for candidates to demonstrate technical proficiency and clear communication when answering questions related to their field of expertise.",
    "The answer provided is too brief and lacks technical detail. To improve, the candidate should discuss a specific optimization technique they have employed while working with MapReduce jobs in Hadoop. This could include custom partitioners, combiners, data compression, or any other strategies used to ensure efficient resource utilization and reduced latency in large-scale data processing scenarios. The response should also explain how this optimization impacted the performance of the MapReduce job in terms of speed, resource consumption, or overall efficiency."
